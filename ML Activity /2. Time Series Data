2. Time Series Data  
Scenario: You have monthly data on electricity consumption over several years and want to predict future consumption based on trends and seasonal patterns.  
Question: Can linear regression be effectively used in this scenario? If so, how would you incorporate time as a variable in your model?


SOLUTION:

Yes, linear regression can be used in time series forecasting for electricity consumption, especially if there are clear trends and seasonal patterns. However, it may not always be the most effective approach since time series data typically benefit from more specialized models, like ARIMA or exponential smoothing methods, which are designed to handle serial correlations in time series. Still, if you choose to use linear regression, you can incorporate time trends and seasonality effectively. Here's how:

Steps to Incorporate Time and Seasonal Patterns with Linear Regression

1. Define the Dependent Variable:
   - The dependent variable, \( Y_t \), is monthly electricity consumption at time \( t \).

2. Incorporate a Trend Component:
   - Add a variable representing time, \( t \), to capture a linear trend. This variable can simply be the sequence of months (1, 2, 3, …, N), where each value represents a consecutive month. The coefficient on \( t \) will help estimate the direction and rate of any trend over time.
   - This leads to a basic model:
     \[
     Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \epsilon_t
     \]
   - Here, \( \beta_1 \) captures the average change in electricity consumption per month.

3. Incorporate Seasonality:
   - Monthly data often show seasonal patterns that repeat yearly. You can capture this by adding dummy variables or sine/cosine terms to represent each month.
   - Dummy variables for months: Create 11 dummy variables (one for each month except one, which acts as a baseline). This will model the unique seasonal effect of each month:
     \[
     Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \beta_2 \text{Month}_2 + \beta_3 \text{Month}_3 + \ldots + \beta_{12} \text{Month}_{12} + \epsilon_t
     \]
   - Fourier terms (sine and cosine): Another approach is to include sine and cosine functions to model seasonality in a smoother way. For monthly data, this could look like:
     \[
     Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \beta_2 \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi t}{12}\right) + \beta_3 \cos\left(\frac{2 \pi t}{12}\right) + \epsilon_t
     \]
   - These terms allow for a repeating seasonal pattern over a 12-month period, capturing regular rises and falls in electricity consumption due to seasonal changes.

4. Consider Autocorrelation:
   - Since time series data often exhibit autocorrelation (values are correlated with past values), consider adding lagged values of \( Y_t \) as independent variables (e.g., \( Y_{t-1} \)) to account for recent past electricity consumption trends.

Final Model

Combining these components, your final regression model could look something like:
\[
Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \sum_{m=2}^{12} \beta_m \text{Month}_m + \epsilon_t
\]
or, using Fourier terms:
\[
Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \beta_2 \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi t}{12}\right) + \beta_3 \cos\left(\frac{2 \pi t}{12}\right) + \epsilon_t
\]

Considerations

1. Residual Analysis: Check residuals for patterns or autocorrelation, as this may indicate that additional autoregressive terms or specialized time series models might be more appropriate.
2. Limitations of Linear Regression for Time Series: Linear regression doesn’t account for dynamic dependencies between consecutive periods as well as time series-specific methods like ARIMA. However, it can still give a straightforward baseline model.
